Challenge completed
Implement a virtual "File manager" using NodeJs. 

You can proceed in following steps:-

Designing a data structure for storing file/folder metadata (hierarchy of files/folder).
Use a database to store it. (can store in file too)
Now create a /browse API this receives a query parameter as path and based on that you can able to explore the file system.
Create a /create API that receives parameters as path, content, type(file or folder).
Similarly create and API endpoint for /delete.
Organise above in a way that it feels like a proper file-manager. (like adding a dialogue for creating a file/folder etc.)

Bonus:

Create /update API endpoint.
Integrate the Update API above properly in UI flow.
